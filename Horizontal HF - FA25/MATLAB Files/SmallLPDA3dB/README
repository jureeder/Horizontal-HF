To begin the data collection process, a small pre-fabricated LPDA (SAS-510-2) was used to verify the efficacy of testing procedures. This directory includes the following files associated with it:

Lpda_pattern.csv 
Recorded received power (distance sweep and Azimuth plots) for -20dBm transmit power for 2GHz, 446MHz, and 290MHz.

SmallLPDAPlots.m
MATLAB code to plot data from .csv file.

distancesweeps.eps
Shows -3dB crossing point for each frequency (from .m file).

3dB.eps
Shows 3dB beamwidth Azimuth plot for each frequency (from .m file).
